# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive. The error arises from using a nonexistent or misspelled utility class within the `@apply` directive.

## Problem

The `@apply` directive is a powerful feature of Tailwind CSS that allows for reusing utility classes. However, if the utility class referenced in `@apply` is misspelled or doesn't exist in your configuration, Tailwind won't produce any error messages, leading to unexpected results.

## Solution

The solution lies in carefully reviewing your Tailwind configuration and ensuring the accuracy of the utility classes used within `@apply` directives. Double-check for typos in your class names and verify that they exist in your Tailwind configuration file.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Run `npm start` (adapt if using another setup)
